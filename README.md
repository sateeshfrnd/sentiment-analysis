# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter/X

## Overview
This project aims to **scrape tweets**  and perform **sentiment analysis** using **TextBlob**. 
Instead of using `tweepy`, which requires API keys and has strict limitations, I leveraged `twkit`, which enables large-scale scraping without restrictions.
The goal is to analyze public sentiment in real-time while exploring **NLP and Generative AI** techniques.

## Why This Project?
- Extracting public sentiment on a trending topic
- Learning how to bypass Twitter API limitations
- Exploring NLP & Generative AI concepts through real-world data
- 
Twitter/X has imposed strict API limitations, making it difficult to scrape data without paid access. Instead of using `tweepy`, which requires API keys, I used `twkit`, which allows fetching **1,000,000 tweets** without hitting rate limits or bans.

## Tech Stack:
- Scraping: twkit (No API keys needed)
- Data Processing: pandas
- Sentiment Analysis: TextBlob (with future plans for VADER, BERT)
- Storage: CSV
